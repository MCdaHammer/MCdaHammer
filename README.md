- 👋 Hi, I’m @MCdaHammer
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code applications and bots via JS or any other recommended code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JS for webpage building and I'm self-teaching myself discord.js and it's possibilities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on discord bots, webpages, or anything that will help me advance my coding knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm on reddit and here on github. I also play a variety of video games on pc and Xbox. My handle everywhere is either MCdaHammer or MCdaHammer1212.
